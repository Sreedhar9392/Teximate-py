# TextiMate Library

**TextiMate** is a Python library designed for automating text extraction, speech recognition, and language translation. It aims to streamline workflows by providing efficient tools for these tasks.

## Features
- **Text Extraction:** Extract text from images using OCR.
- **Speech Recognition:** Convert audio speech to text.
- **Language Translation:** Translate text between different languages.

## Installation

Install TextiMate via pip:


pip install textimate


### Text Extraction

Extract text from an image:

```python
from textimate import TextExtractor

extractor = TextExtractor()
text = extractor.extract_text_from_image('path/to/image.png')
print(text)
```

### Speech Recognition

Convert speech to text from an audio file:

```python
from textimate import SpeechRecognizer

recognizer = SpeechRecognizer()
speech_text = recognizer.convert_speech_to_text('path/to/audio.wav')
print(speech_text)
```

### Language Translation

Translate text to a specified language:

```python
from textimate import Translator

translator = Translator()
translated_text = translator.translate_text('Hello, world!', 'es')
print(translated_text)
```


## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core functionalities and logic.
- **pytesseract:** For OCR capabilities.
- **speech_recognition:** Converts speech to text.
- **googletrans:** Enables language translation.
